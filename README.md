# Angular Exercise Collection

This is a repository for housing the Angular exercises/small projects. See the demonstration of each exercise below.

How to run the code locally?
The exercises/small projects can be run by common server programs such as xampp, nginx, and even Python inbuilt http.server module. The easiest way is to use Python. 

If to use Python, download the "angular" directory and navigate inside it in a terminal. Then run <b>python -m http.server 1234</b>. Open <a href="http://localhost:1234" target="_blank">http://localhost:1234</a> in a browser. Note for "ex003-university-picker" project, <b>json-server</b> should have been installed, then to serve the db.json file, run <b>json-server --watch ex003-university-picker\assets\db.json --port 4000</b>.
